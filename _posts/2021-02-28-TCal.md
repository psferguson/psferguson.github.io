As part of the Munnelyn Instrumentation Lab at Texas A&M, I developed
a calibration instrument [TCal](https://instrumentation.tamu.edu/instruments/tcal/),
similar to [DeCal](http://instrumentation.tamu.edu/decal).
This instrument will be used to characterize relative throughput as a function
of wavelength of imaging systems at observatories around the world.
This calibration will improve the science return from large scale surveys such
as the LSST at the Vera Rubin Observatory, by placing survey follow-up resources
on a common photometric baseline, thus reducing the systematic error due to
combining observations from multiple telescopes.
To characterize a system we use a 2nm wide monochromater based tunable light
source to illuminate the target system to be calibrated and our monitor CCD.
The monitor CCD is calibrated in the lab using a NIST photodiode.
So, the ratio between the signal in the target and monitor is a
measurement of throughput of the target system at a given wavelength.
By repeating this measurement at different wavelengths ranging from 300-1000 nm
we are able to fully characterize the throughput of an instrument + telescope
system as a function of wavelength.
