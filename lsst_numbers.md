title: My Favorite Bonkers LSST Facts

The Legacy Survey of Space and time (<a href='https://www.lsst.org/'><strong>LSST</strong></a>) 
is a planned 10 year survey using the Vera C. Rubin observatory. 
The start of this survey is expected to be in mid-2025, but a more up to date schedule can be found 
at <a href='ls.st/dates'><strong>ls.st/dates</strong></a>. 

This survey will provide us with a truly impressive dataset with which to learn about the universe. 
Some of my favorite lsst numbers are: 

- During the first year of operations LSST will catalog more unique objects than all previous astronomical observations combined.
- Each night we expect 10^6 astrophysical trainsients to be detected and alerts to be sent out within 60s taking an image.

For the full 10 year survey we expect to catalog: 
- 20 x 10^9 galaxies (1% of galaxies in observable universe) 
- 17 x 10^9 resolved stars  
- 10 x 10^6 supernovae (each wide image will like contain 160 active supernovae)  
- 6 x 106 orbits of solar system bodies (by number 95% of the objects we will know in our solar system)  
- 10 time domain events with alerts with 60 seconds

The 10 year survey can be thought of as reaching:
- Hubble deep field depths (g~27.4) over ~20,000 sq deg (wide com)
- Hubble ultra-deep field depths (g~28.7) over ~50 sq deg (deep component)
