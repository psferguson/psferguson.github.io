<p>
  I'm an astrophysicist interested in understanding the nature of dark matter
  by finding and studying the dwarf galaxies and stellar streams in the local
  volume.
  In addition to my <a href='pages/science'> <strong>science</strong></a>, I have
  extensive experience in astronomical
  <a href='pages/science'> <strong>instrumentation</strong></a>
  as well as science validation and calibration for large scale surveys.
</p>
<p>
  Currently, I am helping to build and commission the Vera C. Rubin Observatory
  as a research associate in the observational cosmology group at the
  University of Wisconsin Madison department of physics.
  Previously, I completed a PhD in astrophysics at Texas A&M University.

<p>
Most of my work is done in a science collaborations that include:
<ul>
  <li>Vera C. Rubin Observatory (<a href='https://www.lsst.org/'><strong>LSST</strong></a>)</li>
  <li>Dark Energy Science Collaboration (<a href='https://lsstdesc.org/'><strong>DESC</strong></a>)</li>
  <li>DECam Local Volume Exploration Survey (<a href='https://delve-survey.github.io'><strong>DELVE</strong></a>)</li>
  <!-- <li>Dark Energy Survey (<a href="https://www.darkenergysurvey.org/">DES</a>)</li> -->
  <!-- <li>Southern Stellar Stream Spectroscopic Survey (<a href="https://s5collab.github.io/">S5</a>)</li> -->
</ul>
</p>
<p>
  I am also deeply interested in helping others succeed and transforming academia
  into a more inclusive and supportive environment for all.

<p>
  In my free time I play clawhammer banjo, ultimate frisbee, listen to entirely too much
  music and figure out how to spend more time in nature.
