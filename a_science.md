![DELVE coverage]({{site.baseurl}}/public/images/decam_coverage.png)

My research focuses on understanding the nature of Dark Matter and our galaxy, the Milky Way.
In particular, I use dwarf galaxies and stellar streams as cosmological probes of dark matter
and as probes of the accretion history and mass distribution of the Milky Way.
To, accomplish these goals I am deeply involved in a several wide-field ground
based optical/near-infrared photometric surveys.
Currently, I am a member of the Rubin Observatory Commissioning team and one
of the conveners of the Dark Matter Working group inside the Dark Energy
Science collaboration ([**DESC**](https://lsstdesc.org/)).
I also am a builder for the DECam Local Volume Exploration Survey
([**DELVE**](https://delve-survey.github.io)), and am a member of the Milky Way
working group within the Dark Energy Survey ([**DES**](https://www.darkenergysurvey.org/)).

To learn more about out plans to use Rubin Observatory to constrain the nature of
dark matter see the LSST Dark Matter white paper ([Drlica-Wagner et. al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.01055))
