As an observational astronomer, I am heavily involved in understanding and improving
the infrastructure that allows us to learn about the universe.
I have experience in all stages going from building an instrument to serving
survey catalogs ready for science.


In particular, I have led/helped with:
 * one of the core members of the data analysis group helping to write software
 for analyses to complete system integration and commissioning.
 * Helped lead the creation of `the_monster` a photometric reference catalog
 that will be used for commissioning and early operations of LSST
 * Work in Chile as part of the observing team running tests to verify components
 of the telescope, particularly the M1M3 mirror cell and Telescope Mount Assembly (TMA)
 * Development of software for `faro` and `analysis_tools` which are packages
 within the Rubin Science Pipelines (RSP) to conduct automated verification
 and validation of data processed using the RSP.
 * Ad/hoc validation studies of precursor data processed with the RSP to scope
 out our validation needs during Rubin Observatory commissioning.

 * Data validation / photometric calibration for the DECam Local Volume Exploration

(DELVE) Survey with Dr. Alex Drlica-Wagner. DELVE is a ~25,000 sq deg photometric
survey using DECam archival data and 130 nights of dedicated observations.

 * Developing the instrument TCAL, a mobile spectrophotometric calibration instrument
for imaging systems, at Texas A&M with Dr. Jennifer Marshall and Dr. Darren Depoy.
