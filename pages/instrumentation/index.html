title: Instrumentation

---

As an observational astronomer, I am heavily involved in understanding and improving
the infrastructure that allows us to learn about the universe.
My experience ranges from developing and commissioning instruments and telescopes
to calibration and data validation of large survey level catalogs.
I started working on instrumentation at Texas A&M with Dr. Jennifer Marshall
and Dr. Darren Depoy.
There I developed a TCal a mobile spectrophotometric calibration instrument
for imaging systems.
Subsequently, as another part of my PhD I worked with Dr. Alex Drlica-Wagner
on data validation and calibration for the DECam Local Volume Exploration
(DELVE) Survey.
More recently I have been working on the Vera C. Rubin Observatory helping with
in a number of areas including rapid data analysis for system integration,
developing "the monster" reference catalog to be used for photometric calibration
during commissioning and the first year or so of LSST operations, acting as an
on site observer for integration tests in Chile, and helping to develop software
to compute data quality metrics automatically as part of the Rubin Science Pipelines.
